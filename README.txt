Overview:
    A small system that simulates the running of a elevator-system.
    Input generation and operation's algorithm done in C/C++.
    Graphically presented by Adobe Flash / ActionScript.
Modules:
    Input Generation: 
        Passengers(of the same weight) arrive at each level randomly.
        The frequency of their arrival follows Poisson distribution.
        Their destination should also be random.
    Elevator(s) Management:
        The algorithm retrieves info from the IG module and decides
        which level to go to, and how many passengers to load.
    Graphical Presentation:
        Use pre-calculated data to visualize the operations.
Implementation:
    (not yet decided)
